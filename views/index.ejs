	<h2 id="backup">Designated backup</h2>
	<p>The current designated backup is <b><%= backup %></b>. If someone isn‚Äôt able to come through for a task, the designated backup should bottom line it. They are also a kind of host to this chicken care party and have some extra SMS abilities described below.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>To schedule tasks:</b> send chickenbot the word <code>schedule</code>.</li>
		<li>All messages sent by known people to the chickenbot (except responses to the reminder SMS) get relayed to the backup.</li>
		<li>If someone doesn‚Äôt respond to their task reminder SMS in time, the backup gets notified and is responsible for finding someone to do the task.</li>
		<li><b>To make an announcement:</b> send chickenbot <code>announce: [message]</code> and everything after the colon will get relayed to everyone as chickenbot.</li>
		<li><b>To relay a private message:</b> send chickenbot <code>[name]: [message]</code> with the person's name and everything after the colon will get relayed to them as chickenbot.</li>
