Chicken care task rotation using a Google Sheet and Twilio

## Google Sheet

1. Make a new Google Sheet
2. There should be 4 tabs: Upcoming, Archive, Tasks, People
3. The Upcoming and Archive sheets should each have columns: date, time, task, person, status
4. The Tasks sheet should have columns: name, question, frequency, time
5. The People sheet should have columns: name, phone, status

## Add tasks

Example task:

* name: Close the door
* question: did you close the chickensâ€™ door?
* frequency: 1
* time: 8PM

## Add people

Add names and phone numbers for people who will be caring for the chickens. Assigning the status `active` will include a person in the rotation for a given week.

## Google auth

1. Download a Service Account JSON file from Google Cloud ([instructions](https://theoephraim.github.io/node-google-spreadsheet/#/getting-started/authentication))
2. Copy the `client_email` from the JSON file and share the Google Sheet document with that email address, with edit privileges

## Configuration

1. Copy `config.js.example` to `config.js`
2. Set `chickenbotPhone` as the phone number for the bot (from Twilio)
3. Set `adminPhone` as the number for the admin user (perhaps your cell number)
4. Configure the Google Sheet ID from its URL, and set the filename for the service key json file (saved in the `config` folder)
5. Generate a webhook shared secret at the command line with `openssl rand -hex 40` and configure that value in `webhookSecret`
6. Configure the Twilio SID and auth token from the [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com/)

## Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Run the server

```
npm start
```

## Setup Twilio webhook

Configure the phone number to send webhook requests to the chickenbot server for incoming SMS messages. The URL should be something like `https://chickenbot.example.com/message`.

## Setup Google webhook

1. From the Google Sheet, go to the menu Extensions > Apps Script
2. Paste the code from the file `webhook.gs`
3. Replace the `url` and `secret` variables with your own values
4. Configure `sendWebhook` from the `Head` deployment `from Spreadsheet` to run `on edit`
5. You will need to click through a scary looking "app security warning" to grant access to your spreadsheets

## Admin commands

From the admin phone:

* Send a `schedule` SMS to the chickenbot phone number to schedule tasks for the coming week
* Send `announce: [message]` to relay a message to everyone
* Send `[name]: [message]` to relay a message to a particular person by name
